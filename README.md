This is a demonstration of a server-based blogging web app built using Bootstrap, Node, Express, EJS, Express Session, Mongoose and MongoDB Atlas cloud database. It demonstrates backend Create/Read manipulation of a MongoDB Atlas database hosted on AWS. Node server hosting uses Heroku.

Additional functionality includes subject and author searches, and user signup, login, and authentication functionality.

The basic functionality is based on Greg Lim's tutorial book "Beginning Node.js, Express, and MongoDB" with customisation and improvements added by myself.

The presentation is based on the 'Clean Blog' Bootstrap template provided by startbootstrap.com while images were provided by unsplash.com
